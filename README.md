# EVADERE

- Evadere is a space-horror game for made by my group as our project for HKU's COMP3329 course.

- The default lighting for the environment is set to minimal reflections. If you cannot view anything in the scene view, try toggling the light bulb button on the top left corner of your scene view screen.
- Unity Versions may affect gameplay. We recommend Unity versions above 2020.3.0f1.
